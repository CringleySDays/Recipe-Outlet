## How to contribute?

I'd love to have you on board- however, I want this project to be a learning experience for me. However, if you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/CringleySDays/Recipe-Outlet/issues)!

## How to run the project?

This project is not to be run by anyone other than myself,  it is a learning experience. Additionally, some aspects of the project are not included which makes it difficult to run Recipe Outlet. I hope you understand!
